let hello = 'Ciao';     // number
let age = 18;       // boolean
let isGraduated = false;     // string

console.log(Boolean(hello));
console.log(String(age));
console.log(Number(isGraduated));

// As long as the 'hello' variable has a value it prints out "true",
// it didn't change even when I give it the value '0' because as a string it still had a value.
